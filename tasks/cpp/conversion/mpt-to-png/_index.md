Files with .mpt extension are Microsoft Project template files. These contain basic information and structure along with document settings for creating .MPP files. Such a template file offers default settings such as schedule or budget information for a particular project. It, however, can not save project related data such as tasks, resources or assignments. Once modified, the template files can be saved as standard MPP file for further working with it. Microsoft Project comes with a master template file named "Global.mpt" that is opened when a new template file is to be created. MPT files use application/vnd.ms-project and application/x-project as standard MIME types. MPT files can be opened with Moos Project Viewer, Microsoft Project, and MPXJ programs on Windows, Linux and MacOS platforms.

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
