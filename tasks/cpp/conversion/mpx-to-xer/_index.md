 In order to convert MPX to XER, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Tasks for C++](https://products.aspose.com/tasks/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.tasks) 
 package manager, search for

 Aspose.Tasks is a Microsoft Project API to view and convert project documents. One can load, create, modify and render Microsoft Project files to Primavera, Excel, PDF, HTML, images and XML formats. Aspose.Tasks is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Project or any other software to be installed. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="MPX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/project-management/mpx/" >}}

MPX, Microsoft Exchange File Format, is an ASCII file format for transferring of project information between Microsoft Project (MSP) and other applications that support the MPX file format such as Primavera Project Planner, Sciforma and Timerline Precision Estimating. The MPX file format allows you to transfer project information that cannot appear in a table, such as detailed resource assignment information, calendar information, or information in the Project Info dialog box.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XER" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/project-management/xer/" >}}

The XER file format is a proprietary project file format used by Primavera P6 project planning and management application. Like MPP file format, this file format stores data related to project planning such as tasks, resources, timelines, and materials. Primavera is developed by Oracle and provides the capability of complete project planning and finds its applications in several practical fields such as oil and gas, construction, manufacturing, etc. It helps project managers plan, schedule, and control large-scale programs and individual projects by integrating with financial management and human capital management systems. A number of software and APIs can read and convert XER file to other popular project file formats such as XML and MPP.
