MPX, Microsoft Exchange File Format, is an ASCII file format for transferring of project information between Microsoft Project (MSP) and other applications that support the MPX file format such as Primavera Project Planner, Sciforma and Timerline Precision Estimating. The MPX file format allows you to transfer project information that cannot appear in a table, such as detailed resource assignment information, calendar information, or information in the Project Info dialog box.

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
