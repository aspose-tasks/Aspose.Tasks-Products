A file with MPP extension is Microsoft Project data file that stores information related to project management in an integrated manner. It is proprietary file format developed by Microsoft as file format for Microsoft Project (MSP) which is a project management application software. Besides MPP, MSP supports other file formats as well like project XML schema. Several APIs and applications provide the facility to convert MPP file format to others. Microsoft now has online Project Server where project management files can be uploaded for collaboration by multiple users.

    {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XER" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/project-management/xer/" >}}
The XER file format is a proprietary project file format used by Primavera P6 project planning and management application. Like MPP file format, this file format stores data related to project planning such as tasks, resources, timelines, and materials. Primavera is developed by Oracle and provides the capability of complete project planning and finds its applications in several practical fields such as oil and gas, construction, manufacturing, etc. It helps project managers plan, schedule, and control large-scale programs and individual projects by integrating with financial management and human capital management systems. A number of software and APIs can read and convert XER file to other popular project file formats such as XML and MPP.
